  After a year spent more alone than ever it's interesting to look back at these
  twelve months in music and reflect on how artists' music has resonated. I am
  sure, like me, you have been sound-tracking your time. Collectively this last
  nine months spent rattling around at home has given a lot of time for
  reflection, whether that be introspection, questioning the current
  socio-political settlement or planning a future, what the might be, what we
  might want to take the opportunity to change and how we connect when we can't
  be physically present. It's with this backdrop I'm going to reflect on some of
  my favourite songs and explain why i enjoyed them so much.
